To run the movie 'database', place all downloaded files in the same folder.
Drop this folder into your root directory.
Make sure the latest version of Python 2.7 has been installed.
From the terminal, type 'python [folder name]/entertainment_center.py' to run the web app.
The same will work from the command line on a Windows machine but be sure C:\Python27 is added to your PATH variable.
